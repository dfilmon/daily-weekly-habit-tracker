            1 When I came to you, brothers, I didn''t come with excellence of
            speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God. 2 For
            I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ,
            and him crucified. 3 I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in
            much trembling. 4 My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive
            words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of
            power, 5 that your faith wouldn''t stand in the wisdom of men, but
            in the power of God. 6 We speak wisdom, however, among those who are
            full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of
            this world, who are coming to nothing. 7 But we speak God''s wisdom
            in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God
            foreordained before the worlds for our glory, 8 which none of the
            rulers of this world has known. For had they known it, they
            wouldn''t have crucified the Lord of glory. 9 But as it is written,
            "Things which an eye didn''t see, and an ear didn''t hear, which
            didn''t enter into the heart of man, these God has prepared for
            those who love him." 10 But to us, God revealed them through the
            Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of
            God. 11 For who among men knows the things of a man, except the
            spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things
            of God, except God''s Spirit. 12 But we received, not the spirit of
            the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the
            things that were freely given to us by God. 13 Which things also we
            speak, not in words which man''s wisdom teaches, but which the Holy
            Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things. 14
            Now the natural man doesn''t receive the things of God''s Spirit,
            for they are foolishness to him, and he can''t know them, because
            they are spiritually discerned. 15 But he who is spiritual discerns
            all things, and he himself is judged by no one. 16 "For who has
            known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?" But we
            have Christ''s mind.

            1 Brothers, I couldn''t speak to you as to spiritual, but as to
            fleshly, as to babies in Christ. 2 I fed you with milk, not with
            meat; for you weren''t yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you
            ready, 3 for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is
            jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren''t you fleshly, and
            don''t you walk in the ways of men? 4 For when one says, "I follow
            Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," aren''t you fleshly? 5 Who
            then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you
            believed; and each as the Lord gave to him? 6 I planted. Apollos
            watered. But God gave the increase. 7 So then neither he who plants
            is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase. 8
            Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will
            receive his own reward according to his own labor. 9 For we are
            God''s fellow workers. You are God''s farming, God''s building. 10
            According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise
            master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But
            let each man be careful how he builds on it. 11 For no one can lay
            any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus
            Christ. 12 But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver,
            costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble; 13 each man''s work will be
            revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in
            fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man''s
            work is. 14 If any man''s work remains which he built on it, he will
            receive a reward. 15 If any man''s work is burned, he will suffer
            loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire. 16 Don''t
            you know that you are a temple of God, and that God''s Spirit lives
            in you? 17 If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy
            him; for God''s temple is holy, which you are. 18 Let no one deceive
            himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world,
            let him become a fool, that he may become wise. 19 For the wisdom of
            this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, "He has taken
            the wise in their craftiness." 20 And again, "The Lord knows the
            reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless." 21 Therefore let no
            one boast in men. For all things are yours, 22 whether Paul, or
            Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things
            present, or things to come. All are yours, 23 and you are Christ''s,
            and Christ is God''s.

            1 So let a man think of us as Christ''s servants, and stewards of
            God''s mysteries. 2 Here, moreover, it is required of stewards, that
            they be found faithful. 3 But with me it is a very small thing that
            I should be judged by you, or by man''s judgment. Yes, I don''t
            judge my own self. 4 For I know nothing against myself. Yet I am not
            justified by this, but he who judges me is the Lord. 5 Therefore
            judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both
            bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and reveal the
            counsels of the hearts. Then each man will get his praise from God.
            6 Now these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to
            myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us you might learn not to
            think beyond the things which are written, that none of you be
            puffed up against one another. 7 For who makes you different? And
            what do you have that you didn''t receive? But if you did receive
            it, why do you boast as if you had not received it? 8 You are
            already filled. You have already become rich. You have come to reign
            without us. Yes, and I wish that you did reign, that we also might
            reign with you. 9 For, I think that God has displayed us, the
            apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death. For we are made
            a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men. 10 We are fools
            for Christ''s sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you
            are strong. You have honor, but we have dishonor. 11 Even to this
            present hour we hunger, thirst, are naked, are beaten, and have no
            certain dwelling place. 12 We toil, working with our own hands. When
            people curse us, we bless. Being persecuted, we endure. 13 Being
            defamed, we entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, the dirt
            wiped off by all, even until now. 14 I don''t write these things to
            shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children. 15 For though
            you have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in
            Christ Jesus, I became your father through the Good News. 16 I beg
            you therefore, be imitators of me. 17 Because of this I have sent
            Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord,
            who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach
            everywhere in every assembly. 18 Now some are puffed up, as though I
            were not coming to you. 19 But I will come to you shortly, if the
            Lord is willing. And I will know, not the word of those who are
            puffed up, but the power. 20 For the Kingdom of God is not in word,
            but in power. 21 What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod,
            or in love and a spirit of gentleness?
