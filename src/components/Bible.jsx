              1 When I came to you, brothers, I didn''t come with excellence of
              speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God. 2
              For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus
              Christ, and him crucified. 3 I was with you in weakness, in fear,
              and in much trembling. 4 My speech and my preaching were not in
              persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the
              Spirit and of power, 5 that your faith wouldn''t stand in the
              wisdom of men, but in the power of God. 6 We speak wisdom,
              however, among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this
              world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing.
              7 But we speak God''s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has
              been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for our
              glory, 8 which none of the rulers of this world has known. For had
              they known it, they wouldn''t have crucified the Lord of glory. 9
              But as it is written, "Things which an eye didn''t see, and an ear
              didn''t hear, which didn''t enter into the heart of man, these God
              has prepared for those who love him." 10 But to us, God revealed
              them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes,
              the deep things of God. 11 For who among men knows the things of a
              man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so, no
              one knows the things of God, except God''s Spirit. 12 But we
              received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is
              from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to
              us by God. 13 Which things also we speak, not in words which
              man''s wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches,
              comparing spiritual things with spiritual things. 14 Now the
              natural man doesn''t receive the things of God''s Spirit, for they
              are foolishness to him, and he can''t know them, because they are
              spiritually discerned. 15 But he who is spiritual discerns all
              things, and he himself is judged by no one. 16 "For who has known
              the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?" But we have
              Christ''s mind.
